# KotlinDeepCopy

Provide an easy way to generate `DeepCopy` function for `data class`. DeepCopy only takes effect on the component members i.e. the members declared in the primary constructor.

## Reflection

Use Kotlin Reflection to provide an extension function for `DeepCopyable` so that any data class which implements `DeepCopyable` can simply call `deepCopy()` to copy itsself.

See the test code below: 

```kotlin
data class Speaker(val name: String, val age: Int): DeepCopyable

data class Talk(val name: String, val speaker: Speaker): DeepCopyable

class DeepCopyTest {
    @Test
    fun test() {
        val talk = Talk("DataClass in Action", Speaker("Benny Huo", 30))
        val newTalk = talk.deepCopy()
        assert(talk == newTalk)
        assert(talk !== newTalk)
    }
}
```

`talk` equals `newTalk` since the values of their members are equal while they do not ref to the same object.

### How to Setup

This library has been deloyed to maven center. 

```gradle
implementation("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:deepcopy-reflect:1.7.10.0")
```

## Apt & Ksp

If you concern about the runtime efficiency, apt may be the solution. You can simply annotate the data class you want to deep copy with a `DeepCopy` annotation:

```kotlin
@DeepCopy
data class Speaker(val name: String, val age: Int)
@DeepCopy
data class Talk(val name: String, val speaker: Speaker)
```

Extension function `deepCopy` will be generated according to the components:

```kotlin
fun Talk.deepCopy(name: String = this.name, speaker: Speaker = this.speaker): Talk = Talk(name, speaker.deepCopy())

fun Speaker.deepCopy(
    name: String = this.name,
    age: Int = this.age,
    company: Company = this.company
): Speaker = Speaker(name, age, company.deepCopy()) 
```

Notice that `deepCopy` is called recursively if the member type is also a `data class` annotated with a `DeepCopy` annotation. Hence, if you remove the annotation for `Speaker`, generated function would be like:

```kotlin
fun Talk.deepCopy(name: String = this.name, speaker: Speaker = this.speaker): Talk = Talk(name, speaker)

//And no deepCopy for Speaker.
```

### How to Setup

The artifacts have been deployed to maven central repository. Set up your project by adding these lines:

```gradle
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.7.10-1.0.6" // ksp
    id "org.jetbrains.kotlin.kapt" // kapt
}
...

dependencies {
    ksp("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:deepcopy-compiler-ksp:1.7.10.0") // ksp
    kapt("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:deepcopy-compiler-kapt:1.7.10.0") // kapt
    implementation("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:deepcopy-runtime:1.7.10.0")
}
```

## KCP

This is a nearly perfect version I think. It works like `copy` does. You can install this IntelliJ plugin: [DeepCopy](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/19915-deepcopy-for-kotlin-data-class) and setup your project like this:

```gradle
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.7.10"
    id("com.bennyhuo.kotlin.plugin.deepcopy") version "1.7.10.0"
}

dependencies {
    implementation("com.bennyhuo.kotlin:deepcopy-runtime:1.7.10.0")
}
```

And then try to call the `deepCopy` function directly!

# Change Log

## v1.7.10.0 

Build with Kotlin 1.7.10. 

### Runtime

* Rename `DeepCopiable` to `DeepCopyable` which seems more widely used.

### Reflect

* Make `deepCopy` function available to `DeepCopyable` only.  
* [NEW] Add support for Kotlin JS.

### APT & KSP

* Support multi-module project in a unified way.

### KCP

* Generate a copy-like function `deepCopy` for data classes annotated with `@DeepCopy`.
* Generate implementation of `deepCopy` for data classes implemented `DeepCopyable`.
* Add super type `DeepCopyable` to those data classes annotated with `@DeepCopy`.
* Carefully handle manually written `deepCopy` function.
* Add support for Collections.

## v1.5.0 Reflect & Apt

Compiles on Kotlin v1.5.0. Update `kotlinx-metadata-jvm` to v0.3.0.

## v1.3.72 Apt

Compiles on Kotlin v1.3.72.

* [Bug] Fixed: rewriting DeepCopy.kt.
* [Bug] Fixed: maven dependency scope with runtime module.

## v1.3.0 Apt

* [Feature] Collections/Maps are supported. 
* [Feature] Prebuilt types are supported by annotation `DeepCopyConfig`. See [Prebuilt](apt-impl/sample/src/main/kotlin/com/bennyhuo/kotlin/deepcopy/sample/prebuilt/PrebuiltClass.kt)
* [Bug] Fixed: Data classes with their dependencies should be place into the same package.
* [Bug] Fixed: Improperly import a type variable when component type is not reified.

## v1.2.0 Apt

* [Feature] Add support for nullable types. It will allow copy loop sematically and an exception will be thrown to respond when compiling. See [Recursive.kt](apt-impl/sample/src/main/kotlin/com/bennyhuo/kotlin/deepcopy/sample/recursive/Recursive.kt).

## v1.1.0 Apt 

* [Feature] Add default values to generated `deepCopy` functions.
